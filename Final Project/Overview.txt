1. Design each square mode
	water, ship, hit, miss, red outline(for selection)
2. 4x 2D array to hold p1 ships, p1 hit map, p2 ships, p2 hit map
3. confirm button, some indicator(green header?) to indicate player turn
4. Large W or L overlay screen for win/lose
5. Place ships
	say what size ship needs to be placed
	select 2 squares, confirm valid size (do not highlight second square if not valid)
6. Set up 2nd SSI
	copy lcd.h
	interrupt priority?
7. create functions for outlines/circle

Might want a faster clock for logic, 80MHz? will need to configure divisor for ssi (~6.35MHz max)
